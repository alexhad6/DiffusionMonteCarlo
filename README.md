# DiffusionMonteCarlo

This is a final project for Scientific Computing (Math 164/CS 144) Summer 2020 at Harvey Mudd College. Using MATLAB, I implemented the diffusion Monte Carlo algorithm to numerically approximate the ground state energy and wave function for helium, which cannot be solved exactly. These functions could be adapted and used for other quantum systems in the future.

See [write-up](DiffusionMonteCarlo.pdf) for more information on diffusion Monte Carlo and the code included in this repository.
